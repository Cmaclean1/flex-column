						<p>Hey! I'm <strong>Carly</strong>. I started my journey into coding in August 2018. Currently working on mastering HTML and CSS, the most basic content and styling forms for websites. The next step will be to learn some "real" programming languages like Javascript & JQuery. These are two languages set functions and variables to make the webpage interactive for the user. </p>
						<p>By this time next year I hope to have launched my career as a Freelance web designer. I hope to create beautiful, user friendly pages that help freelancers, businesses, and Non-profits succeed.

			<p> I have lived in <strong>7</strong> different states <strong>&</strong> the District of Columbia. I love animals of all shapes and sizes, and am fascinated by plants and microbes. In my spare time i write, draw and read. Looking for new ways to think about and understand ourselves, and this world. </div>
